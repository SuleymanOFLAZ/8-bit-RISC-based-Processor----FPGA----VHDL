# 8-bit-RISC-based-Processor--FPGA--VHDL

This Repository includes RISC based 8-bit Processor VHDL Codes

The Processor design taken from "Introduction to Loic Circuits & Logic Design with VHDL" book by Brock J. LaMeres
  You can find more detail about the processor and its implementation "Chapter 13: Computer System Design" at page 417 in the book.
  
Simulation was realized in Vivado.
